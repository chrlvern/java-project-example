# java-project-example

These are a few files from thedesktop application of a Loan Management System I am developing
in Java and JavaFX. Since this is a commercial project I cannot upload all files.
This is solely to demonstrate some recent code I've written.

# DBUtils 

This file contains all the methods related to Database manipulation. This app utilizes a MySQL
database. 


# AddLoanController & AddUserController

These files contain the code for the Add Loan and Add User pages respectively. 
It contains the event listeners of all the components on these pages.

#addUser.fxml & addLoan.fxml

These are the xml files that contain the UI for the previously mentioned files.
